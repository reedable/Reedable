    <h1>Reedable <small>Chrome Extension</small></h1>
    <p>
        We declare war against the self-centered,self-absorbed, self-whatever
        web designers, and take back the world wide web for the rest of us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tiny fonts, tightly positioned text, elegant typeface that is impossible
        to see and read... If you have experienced any of these things, we are
        here to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        Override the typeface. Tweak that text space. (Oh, I just rhymed.)
        Reedable Chrome Extension provides the reader (that's you) the freedom
        to choose.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Get <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/fast-and-secure/"
                   target="_blank">Chrome web browser</a> if you do not have one
            yet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Install <a href="#" target="_blank">Reedable Chrome Extension</a>
            from Chrome Web Store.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once the extension is installed, you can access Reedable popup from
        the toolbar by clicking
    </p>
    <img alt="the Reedable icon." class="PictureFrame"
         src="images/Reedable-128.png" width="64">

    <h3>Text spacing</h3>
    <p>
        Enable your Text spacing view preferences by enabling and disabling the
        "Text spacing" checkbox in the popup panel.
    </p>
    <img class="PictureFrame"
         alt="The websites you visit incorporates your view preferences."
         src="images/Reedable_demo_2_TextSpacing.png" width="480">
    <p>
        You can further tweak the parameters by changing the individual
        properties available in the Reedable popup.
    </p>
    <div class="PictureFrame"
         style="width:360px; height:360px; overflow:hidden;">
        <img src="images/Reedable_demo_2_TextSpacing.png" width="960"
             alt="The popup shows Line height of 2, Letter spacing 0.1em, and Word spacing 0.4em."
             style="margin: -32px 0 0 -600px; "
        >
    </div>
    <p>
        Line height value of "2" means "double space." If this is
        too much, try "1.5", "1.25", etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Letter spacing adds extra space between letters. If you feel that the
        page is too crowded, and the letters are starting to run into each
        other, increase this value. You usually need about 0.1em to 0.3em, but
        much more than that, or else you might start having difficulty
        identifying the word breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you can see the letters easily, but if you feel that the words are
        starting to run into each other, you can increase the Word spacing.
        You should not need much more than, say, 0.6em.
    </p>
    <p>
        Line height has no unit, because it is always a relative to the normal
        line height of 1. The Letter spacing and Word spacing can be specified
        in either absolute value or relative value. At present, only the
        following units are supported.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>px</dt>
        <dd>Number of pixels, regardless of the font size.</dd>
        <dt>em</dt>
        <dd>Relative to the width of capital letter M.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Font override</h2>
    <p>
        It is true. We included the capability to view any websites you visit in
        <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" target="_blank">OpenDyslexic</a>
        font in this extension.
    </p>
    <img class="PictureFrame"
         alt="Substitute the typeface in Font override panel."
         src="images/Reedable_demo_3_FontOverride.png" width="480">
    <p>
        There are three input values supported by Font override panel.
    </p>
    <div class="PictureFrame"
         style="width:360px; height:360px; overflow:hidden;">
        <img src="images/Reedable_demo_3_FontOverride.png" width="960"
             alt="Minimum font size, % Font magnification, and Font family."
             style="margin: -32px 0 0 -600px; "
        >
    </div>
    <p>
        To view the websites in OpenDyslexic, Make sure "Font override" checkbox
        is enabled, and select "OpenDyslexic" option from the Font family
        dropdown.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind, you can also use these visual tweaks in combination. You
        can view the pages in OpenDyslexic while increasing the Word spacing and
        Line height, you can do that, too.
