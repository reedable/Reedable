# Reedable Chrome Extension

We declare a thumb war against the self-centered, self-absorbed, 
self-grrrrr-whatever web designers, and take back the world wide web for the
rest of us.

Tiny fonts, tightly positioned text, elegant typeface that no one can see and
read... If you have experienced any of these things, we are here to help.

Override the typeface. Tweak that text space. (Oh, I just rhymed.) Reedable
Chrome Extension provides the reader (that's you) the freedom to choose.
