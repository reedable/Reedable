Line height value of "2" means "double space." If you find this too much, try "1.5", "1.25", etc.</p><p>Letter spacing adds extra space between letters. If you feel that the page is too crowded, and the letters are starting to run into each other, increase this value. You usually need less than 0.3em. Much more than that, you might start having difficulty identifying the word breaks.</p><p>If you can see the letters easily, but if you feel that the words are starting to run into each other, you can increase the Word spacing. You should not need much more than, say, 0.5em.</p><p>Line height has no unit, because it is always relative to the normal line height of 1. The Letter spacing and Word spacing can be specified in either absolute value or relative value. At present, only the following units are supported.</p><!-- TODO Update this list to reflect the implementation--><dl><dt>px</dt><dd>Number of pixels, regardless of the font size.</dd><dt>em</dt><dd>Relative to the width of capital letter M.</dd></dl><h3>Font override</h3><p>It is true.

We come in peace. Take us to your leader.</dd><!-- TODO Link to the main branch instead--><dt>"How much does Reedable cost?"</dt><dd>It is <a href="https://github.com/reedable/Reedable/blob/develop/LICENSE" title="View software license">free</a>.</dd><dt>"How do you make money if it is free?"</dt><dd>We do not make any money off of this, but we are rather good at spending it. If you want to enable our exorbitant spending habits, feel free to <a href="#Donation-heading">send us some Dogecoin</a>, the woofficial currency of the Internet.</dd><dt>"Do you collect and sell my personal information?"</dt><dd>No, we do not collect or sell your personal information. Quite frankly, you do not seem all that interesting. We do, however, rely on third-party services like <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a> to maintain and distribute our work. If any personal information is being collected and/or sold in relationship to Reedable, it is by them, and not by us.</dd><dt>"How do I create a Reedable account?"</dt><dd>Did you read anything we wrote above? We really do not want your personal information, okay? There is no such thing as "account" here. There is no sign-up required for you to use Reedable.</dd><dt>"How do I sign up for your email newsletters?"</dt><dd>I'm glad you asked. For the last friggin' time, We DO NOT want your personal information. Seriously, people, just, just.. just stop giving away your email address to any random websites out there.</dd><dt>"Hey, something is borked.

What for?</p><p>If something is broken, or, you have some smashing ideas about how to make this a better product, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/reedable/Reedable/issues/new">contact us on Github</a>. We do have an email, but we are not going to publish it here because some jerk is going to scrape it and abuse it. Besides, if you really, really want to find out our email address, it is easy. Just hop over to our <a href="https://github.com/reedable/Reedable">Github repository</a> and take a look at our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reedable/Reedable/develop/public-keys/reedable%40oinklet.com.asc">public key</a>[<a class="Footnote" href="#footnote-1" aria-label="Footnote 1">1</a>].</p><h3 id="Donation-heading">Wow! Such support!</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, Reedable is <a href="https://github.com/reedable/Reedable/blob/develop/LICENSE" title="View software license">free</a>. But if you are an eccentric millionaire who wants to buy us some pizza and beer, which fuels this project, we do accept donations.</p><p>We only accept donations in <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin</a>. If you want to support our efforts but have no Dogecoin, that's okay. Please do something nice to an arbitrary stranger, and that will be our payment. Wait an extra five seconds and hold a door for someone behind you. Step aside for a stranger on the sidewalk. Smile and say hello to a person you have not seen before. Wear a mask and get vaccinated during a pandemic (if your doctor recommends it)[<a class="Footnote" href="#footnote-2" aria-label="Footnote 2">2</a>]. You know, things that benefit everyone, not just you.</p><h4>Dogecoin address</h4><p>This is a doggie dog world. If you are going to insist on paying us, here's our Dogecoin address.</p><div class="picture-frame center"><img style="max-width:min(100%,172px); max-height:min(100vh,172px);" alt="QR code: D8ZRv33jaoBuk87aKCMKwoFPSLzVegjWX1" src="/Reedable/assets/image/D8ZRv33jaoBuk87aKCMKwoFPSLzVegjWX1.png"></div><p class="center"><span style="overflow-wrap: anywhere;"><code>D8ZRv33jaoBuk87aKCMKwoFPSLzVegjWX1</code></span></p><p>There is a <a href="/Reedable/assets/image/D8ZRv33jaoBuk87aKCMKwoFPSLzVegjWX1.txt.asc">clearsigned text file</a> with our address. You can use our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reedable/Reedable/develop/public-keys/reedable%40oinklet.com.asc">public key</a> to verify that the address is authentic. Of course, this is all a pointless exercise unless you can trust our public key in your possession, but that is a whole another level of paranoia. If someone forged a public key, tricked you into trusting it, hacked our site, posted their malicious address and signed it with their own key for a handful of Doge, that is more work than we ever did for Reedable Chrome Extension. Maybe they deserve some credit.</p><h2>Footnotes</h2><ol><li class="Note" id="footnote-1">Please encrypt responsibly.</li><li class="Note" id="footnote-2">If you are taking medical advice from people who never attended medical schools or took the Hippocratic Oath, you should reevaluate your life choices.</li></ol></main><a class="skip-link" href="#nav">Skip to navigation menu</a><footer class="page-footer"><hr><small>Copyright &copy; 2021-2022 RBLD.
