    <h1>Test page for Reedable Chrome extension</h1>
    <p>
        This page provides some sample HTML code to test the Reedable Chrome
        extension. There are also links to webpages that were used to test
        the extension during development.

    <h2>Text alignment</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Text alignment, in particular, fully justified text is difficult to
        read by some people. The text should be justified in the direction
        the language is read. If the language is read from left-to-right,
        then left justified text is usually easier to read. Right-to-left
        language, right justification.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Placeholder text</h2>
    <p>
        It turns out... placeholder text is impervious to inline styling.
        We need to figure out how to adjust the placeholder text... and
        even rip the thing out and make it a label, if the label does not
        exist. Looks like we need to inject CSS, according to this page on
        stackoverflow titled "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24545983/change-an-inputs-html5-placeholder-color-with-inline-css">html
        - Change an input's HTML5 placeholder color with inline CSS -
        Stack Overflow</a>".
    </p>
    <label for="placeholder-text-input-0">Greeting</label>
    <input id="placeholder-text-input-0" type="text" placeholder="Hello, world!">

    <h2>Web components</h2>
    <p>
        Web components styling is not affected by document's CSS, and their
        shadowDOM is not exposed to document.querySelectorAll(). We need to
        traverse shadowDOM with our script.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO Web component with shadowRoot -->

    <h2>Pages with !important DOM</h2>
    <p id="important-p-0">
        Some websites have such invasive CSS DOM that even the inline
        styling is overridden. (These sites usually use !important to
        accomplish this.) We need to find a way to identifiy this condition,
        and somehow

    <h2>Tiny text</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 6pt">
        Some sites have this obsession with tiny fonts. Maybe it looks good
        to them, but many people find it difficult to read.
